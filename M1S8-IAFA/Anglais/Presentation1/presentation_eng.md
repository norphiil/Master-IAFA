## Speech notes:

Hello everyone,

Today I'm going to talk about the use of AI in recommender systems. Recommender systems are increasingly used in businesses and digital applications to help users find the products, services, and content that are most relevant to them. Recommender systems can be used for things as simple as Google search, youtube video search or movies suggestion on Netflix or item suggestion on Amazon.

There are several techniques used in recommender systems, such as content analysis it consists of extracting information from the metadata associated with an item, such as the actors in a movie or the keywords in an article. Collaborative filtering witch uses user preferences and behaviors to recommend similar items. and machine learning uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions about user preferences.

Each of these techniques has advantages and disadvantages. But I going to talk more specifically the AI use. The use of AI in recommender systems can be very effective, like for predict a users choice or for found a image or a video by describing it.

(For example, content analysis can be very accurate, but it can also be limited by the quality of available metadata. Collaborative filtering can be very effective for popular items, but may be less useful for lesser known items. Machine learning can be very powerful, but it can also be difficult to understand and explain.
It is possible to combine these different techniques to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations. For example, a system can use content analysis to find similar items, and then use machine learning to predict which items the user will like best.)

There are several challenges and opportunities associated with using AI in recommender systems. One of the most important challenges is privacy. Recommender systems collect and use data about users, so it is crucial to make sure this data is protected and used responsibly. It is also important that systems are transparent, so that users understand how recommendations are generated and what data is used. Finally, there are opportunities to use AI to create more personalized and relevant recommendation systems for users, and to improve the overall user experience. For example soon, Google will be able to add artificial intelligence that will attempt to provide personalized and instantaneous response data in relation to the query.

Recommending can also cause problems such as the filter bubble, which is a phenomenon that occurs when the recommendation algorithms create an environment where users only see a limited selection of content, often related to their interests or preferences. This can lead to a "bubble" in which users are only exposed to a limited viewpoint or opinion, rather than a variety of different perspectives. This can have detrimental consequences for the diversity of ideas and understanding of current events. It a big problematic where many people have discussed and debated this, there is more than one Ted Talk on this topic and it is very interesting in my opinion.

In conclusion, AI is playing an increasingly important role in recommender systems, and there are different techniques for using AI in these systems. However, it is important to manage the challenges of privacy and transparency while using AI to improve recommender systems without restricting the user by limiting his point of view.
